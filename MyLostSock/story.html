    <h1>My Lost Sock</h1>

    <h4>
        You pull a fresh load of clean clothes out of the dryer and spread it out onto your bed. You fold your shirts, hang your pants, toss your underwear into a drawer, until your bed is littered with a lite layer of your socks. One by one you roll them up until you notice a lone sock lingering like an annoying third wheel on a date. Like the animals on Noahâ€™s Ark you're sure that all of the socks went into the wash two by two, so you begin to retrace your steps. You start by looking under your bed, maybe it fell off and slid underneath. Then you walk back to the laundry room and scan the ground and search inside the dryer and washing machine and the surrounding areas. But nothing. Then you check the hamper, because maybe it didn't even make it into the wash, but once again your effort to locate this other sock came up short. You start getting desperate. You call your neighbors, put up "missing sock" signs around your town and contact the local news station all in an effort to find this sock. But, once again you wind up empty handed. At this point you accept the fact that you'll never see your sock again. You start drinking, a little too much at times. You fall into a deep drug and alcohol filled depression. Life is spiraling out of control. You've finally hit rock bottom, until out of the blue your doorbell rings. At the floor is a package. What could possibly be inside?
